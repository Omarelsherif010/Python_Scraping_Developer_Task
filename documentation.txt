TikTok Scraper (Working)
You will find three important files inside TitkTok_Scraper(Working):
1. tiktok_scraper.py -> contains a class called TikTokScraper which includes all the functions needed.
2. streamlit_app.py -> contains easy to use interface to play around the scraping functions
3. requirements.txt -> contains all the required packages to run the code (Main packages are selenium, pymongo, beautifulsoup, streamlit)

To run the code on you device, you need to do the following steps:
1. create virtual environment to install our libraries inside through this command 'python -m venv venv'
2. activate the venv through 'source venv/Scripts/activate' (this command is for bash)
3. install all required libraries from requirements.txt file by running this command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
4. you can run the code in two ways:
    1- run tiktok_scraper.py directly after you enter (keyword or username) in main function at the end of the file
    2- run streamlit_app.py to have nice interface in which you can enter (keyword, username, db_name, collection)
        , you can do this through this command 'streamlit run streamlit_app.py' (make sure you are inside TitkTok_Scraper directory)
5. fill the required fields and let the magic happen
6. check your MongoDB collection and congratulation
